# JSS (Just Survive, Somehow)
A mod for the game 7 Days To Die (A17)

This mod's purpose is to tailor the game toward scavenging and exploration with more emphasis on learning skills by discovering them rather than by using the perk system in A17. The perk system is still centrally used to level up your base attributes. When a skill is learned by reading the appropriate book, it is retained indefinitely (there are no time-limited perks such as the perk magazines in A17 vanilla). 

Part of this overhaul is that the traders are a more relevant feature of the game. They will buy most things and also offer more and a better variety of things. Skill books that you can't seem to scavenge can be purchased from traders using money you earn by selling them what you can find or make. You can earn more money by selling value-added items (things you craft from basic materials) than by just selling the basic materials. Traders will also offer you skill books in reward for completing their quests.

There is also a greater variety of loot in the game. This includes new types of meat, new canned foods, and new crops as described below.

And lastly, you will begin the game by choosing your player's previous career using a starter class paper. This will grant you specific initial knowledge and items based on what you choose.

# New item types

* Pork, Bear Meat, Wolf Meat, Snake Meat, Rabbit Meat, Venison, and Chicken meat.
* Strawberries (can be harvested in the wild in pine forest and cultivated)

# Starter Classes

When you start a new game your player will have an item called "Starter Class Paper" which can be crafted into one of the available class types.  When you craft it into a type then you will receive a satchel with that class's starter items.  Place the satchel on the ground and punch it to get your items.   Each class starts with a couple relevent skill books and one handy item as detailed below.  This has no further affect on the game, it is just a way to begin with some loot that reflects your interests.
