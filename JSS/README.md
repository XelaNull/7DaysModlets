# JSS (Just Survive, Somehow)
A mod for the game 7 Days To Die (A17)

This mod uses the xpath modding system supported by 7dt4 version A17.  This means that installing it does not alter any of your 7Days files, and the mod is installed automatically by the game engine at runtime.  

To install the mod, all you have to do is unzip the master files into the Mods folder (e.g. mine is e:\steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\)

# About this Mod

This mod's purpose is to embrace the survival-by-scavenging and exploration style of play.  The perk system is still used for leveling up your base attributes and abilities, but most skills must be learned by finding books, journals, or schematics in the world.  Once learned, skills are retained (no time-limited perks).  The traders offer more goods and also give prices more commensurate with the value of the items you can scavenge or craft.  

# New item types

* Pork, Bear Meat, Wolf Meat, Snake Meat, Rabbit Meat, Venison, and Chicken meat.
* Strawberries (can be harvested in the wild in pine forest and cultivated)
* Herbs (can be harvested from regular grasses)
* Moss (harvested from moss in caves and sometimes from tall pine trees)
* Starter Class paper lets you choose your player's previous proffession.
* 5 Novel genres
* Encyclopedia - 26 Volumes, collect the whole set!  (Seriously, collect them all and craft a Encyclopedia Set for a significant XP reward and trader value)

# Starter Classes

When you start a new game your player will have an item called "Starter Class Paper" which can be crafted into one of the available class types.  When you craft it into a type then you will receive a satchel with that class's starter items.  Place the satchel on the ground and punch it to get your items.   Each class starts with a couple relevent skill books and one handy item as detailed below.  This has no further affect on the game, it is just a way to begin with some loot that reflects your interests.
