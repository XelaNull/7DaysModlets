# TheWildLand
A mod for the game 7 Days To Die (A17)

The goal of the mod was to revamp the Biome generation for Random World Generation (RWG) game worlds.  I created new Biomes (Prairie, Alpine Forest), removed most of the burnt forest, moved the wasteland biome to the far perimeter of the map, and rescaled the existing biomes so they are a bit larger than as generated by A17 vanilla (as of build B240).  

This mod uses the xpath modding system supported by 7dtd version A17.  This means that installing it does not alter any of your 7Days files, and the mod is installed automatically by the game engine at runtime.  

To install the mod, all you have to do is unzip the master files into the Mods folder (e.g. mine is e:\steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\)

# About this Mod

Welcome to The Wild Land, the sole remaining oasis of habitable land on the planet.  The land is a vast territory, 
surrounded by a wasteland polluted with radiation.  

## New Biomes

* Prairie.  Mainly a grassland, with skattering of blueberry, flowers, some wild corn and small cactus.  Sub biomes within the prairie should yield different base types like clay, stand, stone, etc.  Lead-rich boulders found here.
* Alpine Forest.  Populated with birch trees and oaks, with boulders dominate with iron ore.  Birch tree models were imported from the War of the Walkers mod (A16). 

## Changes to existing biomes

* Wasteland perimeter (leading to radiation zone) surrounds the world.
* Very little burnt forest or wasteland within the habitable perimeter.
* Nitrate-rich boulders in the desert.
* Reduced oak prevalence in pine forest to make it more piney.  Thinned underbrush but added azalea bushes.  
* More water than in A17 vanilla.

## Changes to town generation 

* Decreases relative probability of industrial group and residential buildings in towns order to increase commercial and downtown groups.
* Made the relative probability of small pharma to be about the same as other small stores (it was overweighted).
* Made the relative probability of all skyscraper prefabs the same (04 was overweight).
